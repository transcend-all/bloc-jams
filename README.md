# Bloc Jams
Bloc Jams is a Spotify clone, part of the coursework at Bloc. It demonstrates what I have learned about HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, DOM Scripting, and the Buzz Music API as of November 2016.

Once cloned to your local machine, the site can be run on a standard web browser by simply double-clicking on index.html. To get to the music, click the "collection" link in the top-right corner, then on any album.
